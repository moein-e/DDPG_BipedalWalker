# RL: BipedalWalker

Here is my fun side project to train an agent to walk in the **BipedalWalker** environment using **Reinforcement Learning**.
The environment is obtained from Gym OpenAI ([here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/)). 
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (**DDPG**) method with epsilon-decay exploration is used in this work.

Here is the result after training:

The agent is also trained on a more complex version of the BipedalWalker environment ([BipedalWalkerHardcore](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalkerHardcore-v2/)) in another [repository](https://github.com/moein-e/RL_BipedalWalker_Hardcore).
