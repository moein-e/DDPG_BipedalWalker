# RL: BipedalWalker

Here is my fun side project to train an agent to walk in the **BipedalWalker** environment using **Reinforcement Learning**.
The environment is obtained from Gym OpenAI ([here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2/)). 
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (**DDPG**) method with epsilon-decay exploration is used in this work.

Here is the result after training:
